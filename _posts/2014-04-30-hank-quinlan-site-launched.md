<p> I've been working on some RMarkdown scripting today. I was planning to use it to write a blogpost to go up on <a href = "http://timefreq.wordpress.com">The Time-Frequency Transform</a>, which has been gathering dust for a year or two now. It seems like a bit of a faff to convert it to a Wordpress friendly format, so naturally I decided to create an entire new website for myself over here on Github. Obviously that's bound to be a lot less work. </p>
