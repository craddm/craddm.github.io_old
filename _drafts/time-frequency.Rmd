## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(psd)
library(multitaper)
```

## Including Plots
```{r}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
clean_data <- read_csv('C:\\Users\\Matt\\Documents\\Github\\ExploringERPs\\epochs_clean.csv', progress = FALSE) %>%
  gather(electrode,amplitude, -condition, -epoch, -time) 
```

```{r}

tmp_tf <- clean_data %>% filter(epoch == 128 & electrode == "Oz") 

freqs <- list(seq(4, 30, by = 2))
tmp_tf[seq(1,230, 4),]

library(WaveletComp)
bb <- analyze.wavelet(tmp_tf, my.series = "amplitude")
wt.image(bb)
```
```{r}
library(wavelets)

freqs <- list(seq(6, 30, by = 2))
cycles <- 4
win_length <- (cycles/freqs[[1]])*1000
(tmp_tf$time-(win_length[13]/2) >= min(tmp_tf$time)) & (tmp_tf$time+(win_length[13]/2) <= max(tmp_tf$time))


```
