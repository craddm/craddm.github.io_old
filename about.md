title: About Me 
---

<p>I'm a post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Leeds, UK. I currently study how pre-stimulus brain activity influences perception. I work with Dr Donna Lloyd and the <a href = "http://www.leeds.ac.uk/coni/">Cognitive Neuroimaging Group</a> in the School of Psychology. I use electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI), and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).</p>
	
<p> I've built this page on Github primarily using RMarkdown through RStudio. I've had some help along the way from existing Github repositorites and themes for Jekyll - specifically, I'm using <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a>, inspired by Homer White, whose <a href="http://statistics.rainandrhino.org/">R Contour</a> blog I stumbled on while googling for ideas. </p>
