title: About Me 
---
<p>I'm a post-doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Leeds, UK. 
	I currently study how pre-stimulus brain activity influences perception. 
	I work with Dr Donna Lloyd and the <a href = "http://www.leeds.ac.uk/coni/">Cognitive Neuroimaging Group</a> 
	in the School of Psychology. I use electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI), 
	and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).</p>
	
	<p>I've built this page on Github primarily using RMarkdown through RStudio. I've had some help along the way from existing Github repositorites and themes for Jekyll - specifically Hyde.</p>
